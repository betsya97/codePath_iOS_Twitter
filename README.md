## Notes 
There were similarities between the Flix App in that both projects required the use of tableView cells and API calling. New features I learned in Part 1 of recreating the Twitter app was learning to implement infinite scrolling and scroll up to refresh. This portion of the project was a good refresher on how to begin an app starting from placing an app icon on the home page to the complete functionality.
