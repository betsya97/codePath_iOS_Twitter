## Notes 
Part 2 was more challenging because the Tweet Page has to be implemented while minding the constraints for the Like and Retweet Buttons. It was good practice for me to pick around the constraints to make it more dynamic and make the extra buttons adjust according to the text field size.

## Notes 
There were similarities between the Flix App in that both projects required the use of tableView cells and API calling. New features I learned in Part 1 of recreating the Twitter app was learning to implement infinite scrolling and scroll up to refresh. This portion of the project was a good refresher on how to begin an app starting from placing an app icon on the home page to the complete functionality.
